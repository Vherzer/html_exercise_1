		<div>	
			<p>I'll wait for you till I turn blue 
				There's nothin' more a man can do 
				Don't get your bollocks in a twist 
				Settle down, don't take a fit 
				Ya drank with demons straight form Hell 
				They almost nearly won as well 
				Ya wiped the floor with victory 
				Then puked until you fell asleep</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Blackened was the banshee's wail 
				These boot will never fill her jail 
				So you crawled into an empty boat 
				For the Gulf of Mexico 
				Till Cortez came an' when so did you 
				From the ashes charred and blue 
				Smellin' like a Salty Dog 
				Back from Hell where you belong</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Anarchy, the scourge of every sea 
				The Antichrist aboard a rig 
				With us your cutthroat thieves 
				The ship went down we all near drowned 
				Ya stood there on the deck 
				Till the Spanish came and flogged yer arse 
				And dragged you from the wreck</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>They threw a rope around yer neck 
				To watch you dance the jig of death 
				Then left ya for the starvin' crows 
				Hoverin' like hungry whores 
				The other he had in his sights 
				Ya snarled at him, said leave me be 
				I need the bugger so I can see<p>
