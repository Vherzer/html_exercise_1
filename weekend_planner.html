				<li>Schönbrunn Zoo is the oldest zoo in the world. In 1752 Emperor Franz I, Stephan von Lothringen, the husband of Maria Theresia had a menagerie built around a central pavilion. Originally his menagerie of “rare animals” was reserved to the imperial family and noble guests. From the year 1778 it was also opened on Sundays for all “decently dressed persons”.
				Today, Schönbrunn Zoo with its more than 2 million visitors yearly, has become a much-liked local recreation area and attraction for Vienna-tourists from all over the world. </li> <br>
